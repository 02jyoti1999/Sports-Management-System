The more you get to know and understand your current and potential members, the greater chance you have of providing them with a positive experience.
Everyone who plays sport, participates in physical activity, coaches or volunteers does so for different reasons. There is lots of research around why people take part in sport. Once you understand these motivations (and there can be several for one person) you can start to create a positive environment that people want to be part of.
Likewise, by identifying what might prevent them from participating in your sport or joining your club, you can start to address these barriers and make your club a more welcoming place that they want to be part of.
